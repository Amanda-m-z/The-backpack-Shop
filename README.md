#The backpack shop
##The backpack shop## is a group project focused on building a store simulation. Users can browse trough products, add them to a cart and simulate a purchase without actual payment processing. 


## Key Features
The web application allows users to:

- Browse a catalog of backpacks with images, descriptions, and prices
- Filter and sort products (UI only)
- Add and remove items from a shopping cart, adjust quantities, and see total cost
- Explore popular products and latest arrivals on the homepage
- Simulate a checkout process
- 
This project showcases full-stack development, responsive design, and collaborative teamwork using Git and GitHub.

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- LocalStorage 
- Axios

## My Contribution
- Created the JSON file for product data and implemented Axios requests to fetch data
- Developed the product page with a grid layout, including filter and sort buttons (UI only)
- Built the backend API to serve product data to the frontend
- Implemented full shopping cart functionality: add, remove, increase, decrease items, and calculate total cost
- Created homepage sections for popular products and latest arrivals

## What I Learned

- How to fetch and handle data from a backend using Axios and JSON  
- Frontend layout design with React and CSS Grid  
- Implementing dynamic shopping cart functionality  
- Creating interactive UI elements like filters and product highlights  
- Integrating frontend and backend systems  
- Collaborative development workflow using Git

## Future Improvements

Based on feedback and potential enhancements, the following improvements could make the project more robust and closer to production-ready:

- **Standardize file and folder structure:** Ensure consistent naming conventions for files and imports to improve maintainability and cross-platform stability.  
- **Enhance navigation robustness:** Replace fragile relative paths with consistent absolute paths or centralized routing helpers to prevent broken links.  
- **Implement API error handling:** Use `try/catch` for Axios requests and provide fallback UI (e.g., empty list, error message, or loader) for better user experience.  
- **Refactor reusable components:** Reduce duplicated DOM rendering code (e.g., product cards) by creating reusable functions or components for consistency and maintainability.
